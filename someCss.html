	<h1>Paragraphs</h1>
	<p class="ex1">Informatics 101 is such a fun class. We get to cheer, make viral videos, and do tons of other activities. It has also been interesting learning about popular social media and gaming applications.</p>

	<p class="ex2">Before this quarter, I have never coded. I am enjoying coding in both this class and Statistics 311. I hope to continue to do this more in the future.</p>
